## v0.5.0 (September 30, 2019)

 ### Notes

 - This release is not backward compatible with the previous versions of Swarm. Please update your nodes.
 - Ubuntu PPA support has been removed. We will add support for multiple software distribution platforms at a later stage. In the meanwhile you can still find the Swarm binaries at out [official download page](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/swarm.eth/downloads/).

 ### Features

 - **Content Pinning:** You can now pin content to your local swarm node. This way you can guarantee that certain content stays on your node. You can enable pinning by setting the `--enable-pinning` flag. For more information, read the [documentation](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dapp_developer/index.html#pinning-content).

The following features are **experimental** and are **not enabled by default on our public testnet**. If you want to test these features, make sure to use a separate network (e.g. create your own swarm cluster) and set the same feature flags on all nodes.

 - **Push sync:** Additionally to our previous syncing algorithm, pull sync, we now also have "push sync" as an option available to synchronise the content across nodes. If you want to try it out, you have to start you swarm node with `--sync-mode=all`.
 - **Progress bar via Tags:** [Tags](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dapp_developer/index.html#tags) allow you to track the progress on content uploads. When using `swarm up`, you can now use the `--track` flag to see the upload progress. This feature requires push sync to be enabled.
 - **SWAP:** A first version of of the SWarm Accounting Protocol (SWAP) is implemented. SWAP is a tit-for-tat incentive system where nodes account how much data they request and serve to their peers. If a node consumes significantly more than it provides, it pays for the consumed data using a L2 payment system: the chequebook. You can try SWAP on a SWAP enabled network with the flags --swap --swap-backend-url=<evm_endpoint> or learn more in the [SW3 paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yszmsdqyqbvc) , [Swap, Swear, and Swindle Games video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cgyhsjsfbg) or [this article](https://www.rifos.org/blog/rif-storage-the-first-chunks/). The economics of this system is still in a highly experimental state.
- **BzzEth:** This is a new protocol that enables Ethereum and Swarm nodes to communicate with each other and help Ethereum nodes distribute blockchain data and state data over Swarm, enabling various functionalities like state syncing via Swarm and light client support. This release includes the preliminary phase of supporting blockchain on Swarm. This is experimental work that can be trialled with a dedicated version of the Ethereum Trinity client.

## v0.4.3 (July 25, 2019)

### Notes

- **Docker users:** The `$PASSWORD` and `$DATADIR` environment variables are not supported anymore since this release. From now on you should mount the password or data directories as volumes. For example:
  ```bash
  $ docker run -it -v $PWD/hostdata:/data \
                   -v $PWD/password:/password \
                   ethersphere/swarm:0.4.3 \
                     --datadir /data \
                     --password /password
  ```

The code is now under [ethersphere/swarm](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm)
* New docker images (>=0.4.0) can now be found under https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/swarm

## v0.4.0 (May 17, 2019)

### Changes

* Implemented parallel feed lookups within Swarm Feeds
* Updated syncing protocol subscription algorithm
* Implemented EIP-1577 - Multiaddr support for ENS
* Improved LocalStore implementation
* Added support for syncing tags which provide the ability to measure how long it will take for an uploaded file to sync to the network
* Fixed data race bugs within PSS
* Improved end-to-end integration tests
* Various performance improvements and bug fixes
* Improved instrumentation - metrics and OpenTracing traces

### Notes
This release is not backward compatible with the previous versions of Swarm due to the new LocalStore implementation. If you wish to keep your data, you should run a data migration prior to running this version.

BZZ network ID has been updated to 4.

Swarm v0.4.0 introduces major changes to the existing codebase. Among other things, the storage layer has been rewritten to be more modular and flexible in a manner that will accommodate for our future needs. Since Swarm at this point does not provide any storage guarantees, we have made the decision to not impose any migrations on the nodes that we maintain as part of the public test network, nor on our users. We have provided a [manual](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/blob/master/docs/Migration-v0.3-to-v0.4.md) for those of you who are running private deployments and would like to migrate your data to the new local storage schema.
