## v0.5.5 (Unreleased)

## v0.5.4 (November 29, 2019)

### Notes

- This release fixes a possible error with the data migration that was introduced in 0.5.3 and an optimization that mitigates I/O bottlenecks when syncing
- Users can directly use this version from previous versions, there's no explicit need to run 0.5.3 before running 0.5.4

### Commits

* [#1993](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1993) stream: avoid repeated SetSyncPull for chunk
* [#1980](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1980) localstore: skip tag not found on migration
* [#1980](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1980) shed: RenameIndex return true if index is already renamed


## v0.5.3 (November 27, 2019)

### Notes

- This release brings a change in the Swarm retrieval protocol that blocks the delivery of unsolicited chunks
- A critical bug that caused the size of the Swarm node to overflow its designated storage size was fixed
- A limit on the number of peers being synced to on bin zero has been introduced to the stream protocol
- A lookahead buffered reader was introduced in order to speed up downloads by prefetching chunks
- A data migration was introduced in order to rename an index in the local store
- Tags are now persisted across node sessions, so you can keep track over your uploads when you restart your node
- Numerous data races have been fixed
- Push sync is now enabled by default
- Garbage collection and fetcher timeouts have changed, so you should be getting an overall better user experience with this version

### Features

- When uploading a file from the landing page at localhost:8500, progress bars would now be shown to indicate the progress of the upload

## v0.5.2 (October 07, 2019)

### Notes

- This release includes a small fix to avoid connections to the default bootnodes when not using the default testnet.

### Commits

* [#1865](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1865) cmd/swarm: nullify bootnodes before check for network id
* [#1862](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1862) cmd/swarm: only use the default bootnodes on the default network id

## v0.5.1 (October 03, 2019)

### Notes

- This release just includes some minor bugfixes.
- If you have a push sync enabled cluster, you now need to provide the `--progress` flag to `swarm up` if you want to see the progress bar.

## v0.5.0 (September 30, 2019)

### Notes

 - This release is not backward compatible with the previous versions of Swarm. Please update your nodes.
 - Ubuntu PPA support has been removed. We will add support for multiple software distribution platforms at a later stage. In the meanwhile you can still find the Swarm binaries at the [official download page](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/swarm.eth/downloads/).

### Features

 - **Content Pinning:** You can now pin content to your local swarm node. This way you can guarantee that certain content stays on your node. You can enable pinning by setting the `--enable-pinning` flag. For more information, read the [documentation](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dapp_developer/index.html#pinning-content).

The following features are **experimental** and are **not enabled by default on our public testnet**. If you want to test these features, make sure to use a separate network (e.g. create your own swarm cluster) and set the same feature flags on all nodes.

 - **Push sync:** Additionally to our previous syncing algorithm, pull sync, we now also have [push sync](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/go_client_contributor.html#structural-components-and-key-processes) as an option available to synchronise the content across nodes. If you want to try it out, you have to start you swarm node with `--sync-mode=all`.
 - **Progress bar via Tags:** You can now track your upload progress when you use `swarm up`. This is possible due to [tags](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dapp_developer/index.html#tags). This feature requires push sync to be enabled.
 - **SWAP:** A first version of of the SWarm Accounting Protocol (SWAP) is implemented. SWAP is a tit-for-tat incentive system where nodes account how much data they request and serve to their peers. If a node consumes significantly more than it provides, it pays for the consumed data using a L2 payment system: the chequebook. You can try SWAP on a SWAP enabled network with the flags `--swap --swap-backend-url=<evm_endpoint>` or learn more in the [SW3 paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yszmsdqyqbvc) , [Swap, Swear, and Swindle Games video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cgyhsjsfbg) or [this article](https://www.rifos.org/blog/rif-storage-the-first-chunks/). The economics of this system is still in a highly experimental state.
- **BzzEth:** This is a new protocol that enables Ethereum and Swarm nodes to communicate with each other and help Ethereum nodes distribute blockchain data and state data over Swarm, enabling various functionalities like state syncing via Swarm and light client support. This release includes the preliminary phase of supporting blockchain on Swarm. This is experimental work that can be trialled with a dedicated version of the Ethereum Trinity client. For more information check out [Ethereum header chain over Swarm](https://github.com/ethersphere/user-stories/issues/9).

## v0.4.3 (July 25, 2019)

### Notes

- **Docker users:** The `$PASSWORD` and `$DATADIR` environment variables are not supported anymore since this release. From now on you should mount the password or data directories as volumes. For example:
  ```bash
  $ docker run -it -v $PWD/hostdata:/data \
                   -v $PWD/password:/password \
                   ethersphere/swarm:0.4.3 \
                     --datadir /data \
                     --password /password
  ```

The code is now under [ethersphere/swarm](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm)
* New docker images (>=0.4.0) can now be found under https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/swarm

## v0.4.0 (May 17, 2019)

### Changes

* Implemented parallel feed lookups within Swarm Feeds
* Updated syncing protocol subscription algorithm
* Implemented EIP-1577 - Multiaddr support for ENS
* Improved LocalStore implementation
* Added support for syncing tags which provide the ability to measure how long it will take for an uploaded file to sync to the network
* Fixed data race bugs within PSS
* Improved end-to-end integration tests
* Various performance improvements and bug fixes
* Improved instrumentation - metrics and OpenTracing traces

### Notes
This release is not backward compatible with the previous versions of Swarm due to the new LocalStore implementation. If you wish to keep your data, you should run a data migration prior to running this version.

BZZ network ID has been updated to 4.

Swarm v0.4.0 introduces major changes to the existing codebase. Among other things, the storage layer has been rewritten to be more modular and flexible in a manner that will accommodate for our future needs. Since Swarm at this point does not provide any storage guarantees, we have made the decision to not impose any migrations on the nodes that we maintain as part of the public test network, nor on our users. We have provided a [manual](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/blob/master/docs/Migration-v0.3-to-v0.4.md) for those of you who are running private deployments and would like to migrate your data to the new local storage schema.
